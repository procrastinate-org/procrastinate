# Test your code that uses Procrastinate

Procrastinate defines an {py:class}`InMemoryConnector` that will speed up your tests,
remove dependency to PostgreSQL and allow you to have tasks run in a
controlled way.

To use it, you can do:

```
app = procrastinate.App(connector=procrastinate.testing.InMemoryConnector())

# Run the jobs your tests created, then stop the worker
app.run_worker(wait=False)

# See the jobs created:
print(app.connector.jobs)

# Reset the "in-memory pseudo-database" between tests:
app.connector.reset()
```
