# Define a retry strategy on a task

We sometimes know in advance that a task may fail randomly. For example a task
fetching resources on another network. You can define a retry strategy on a
task and Procrastinate will enforce it.

Note that a job waiting to be retried lives in the database. It will persist across
app / machine reboots.

## Simple strategies

- Retry 5 times (so 6 attempts total):

  ```
  @app.task(retry=5)
  def flaky_task():
      if random.random() > 0.9:
          raise Exception("Who could have seen this coming?")
      print("Hello world")
  ```

- Retry indefinitely:

  ```
  @app.task(retry=True)
  def flaky_task():
      if random.random() > 0.9:
          raise Exception("Who could have seen this coming?")
      print("Hello world")
  ```

## Advanced strategies

Advanced strategies let you:

- define a maximum number of retries (if you don't, jobs will be retried indefinitely
  until they pass)
- define the retry delay, with constant, linear and exponential backoff options (if
  you don't, jobs will be retried immediately)
- define the exception types you want to retry on (if you don't, jobs will be retried
  on any type of exceptions)

Define your precise strategy using a {py:class}`RetryStrategy` instance:

```
from procrastinate import RetryStrategy

@app.task(retry=procrastinate.RetryStrategy(
    max_attempts=10,
    wait=5,
    retry_exceptions={ConnectionError, IOError}
))
def my_other_task():
    print("Hello world")
```

{py:class}`RetryStrategy` takes 3 parameters related to how long it will wait
between retries:

- `wait=5` to wait 5 seconds before each retry
- `linear_wait=5` to wait 5 seconds then 10 then 15 and so on
- `exponential_wait=5` to wait 5 seconds then 25 then 125 and so on

## Implementing your own strategy

- If you want to go for a fully fledged custom retry strategy, you can implement your
  own retry strategy (though we recommend always keeping a max_retry):

  ```
  import random

  class RandomRetryStrategy(procrastinate.BaseRetryStrategy):
      max_attempts = 3
      min = 1
      max = 10

      def get_schedule_in(self, *, exception:Exception, attempts: int, **kwargs) -> int:
          if attempts >= max_attempts:
              return None

          return random.uniform(self.min, self.max)
  ```

It's interesting to add a catch-all parameter `**kwargs` to make your strategy more
resilient to possible changes of Procrastinate in the future.
