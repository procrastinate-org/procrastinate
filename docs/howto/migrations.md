# Migrate the Procrastinate schema

When Procrastinate developers make changes to the Procrastinate database schema – the
`schema.sql` file in the code base – they need to write migration scripts.

Here's an example of a migration script:

```sql
ALTER TABLE procrastinate_jobs ADD COLUMN extra TEXT;
```

The migration scripts are pure-SQL scripts, meaning that they may be applied to the
database using any PostgreSQL client, including `psql` and `PGAdmin`.

:::{note}
If you use Django, instead of using the SQL migration scripts directly, you way want
to rely on the Procrastinate Django app, and the Django database migration scripts
this app provides. See {doc}`django` for more information.
:::

The migration scripts are located in the `procrastinate/sql/migrations` directory of
the Procrastinate Git repository. They're also shipped in the Python packages published
on PyPI.

The names of migration script files adhere to a certain pattern:

```
xx.yy.zz_ab_very_short_description_of_the_migration.sql
```

- `xx.yy.zz` is the version of Procrastinate the migration script can be applied to.
- `ab` is the migration script's serial number, `01` being the first number in the
  series.

Let's say you are currently using Procrastinate 1.9.0, and you want to update to
Procrastinate 1.15.0. In that case, before upgrading the Procrastinate Python package
(from 1.9.0 to 1.15.0), you will need to apply all the migration scripts whose versions
are greater than or equal to 1.9.0, and lower than 1.15.0 (1.9.0 ≤ version \< 1.15.0).
And you will apply them in version order, and, for a version, in serial number order.
For example, you will apply the following migration scripts, in that order:

1. `01.09.00_01_xxxxx.sql`
2. `01.10.00_01_xxxxx.sql`
3. `01.11.00_01_xxxxx.sql`
4. `01.11.00_02_xxxxx.sql`
5. `01.12.00_01_xxxxx.sql`
6. `01.14.00_01_xxxxx.sql`
7. `01.14.00_02_xxxxx.sql`

If you want to upgrade from one Procrastinate major version to another, say from
Procrastinate 1.6.0 to 3.2.0, there are two options, depending on whether you can
interrupt the service to do the migration or not.

## The easier way, with service interruption

1. Shut down the services that use Procrastinate: both the services that defer tasks and
   the workers.
2. Apply all the migration scripts (1.6.0 ≤ version \< 3.2.0).
3. Upgrade your code to the new Procrastinate version (3.2.0).
4. Start all the services.

This, as you've noticed, only works if you're able to stop the services.

## The safer way, without service interruption

:::{note}
This only applies starting at Procrastinate 0.17.0. For previous versions,
you will have to interrupt the service or write custom migrations.

If you care about service continuity, you'll need to make intermediate upgrades. For
example, to upgrade from Procrastinate 1.6.0 to 3.2.0, here are the steps you will need
to follow:

1. Apply all the migration scripts between 1.6.0 and 2.0.0 (1.6.0 ≤ version \< 2.0.0).
2. Live-upgrade the Procrastinate version used in your services, from 1.6.0 to 2.0.0.
3. Apply all the migration scripts between 2.0.0 and 3.0.0 (2.0.0 ≤ version \< 3.0.0).
4. Live-upgrade the Procrastinate version used in your services, from 2.0.0 to 3.0.0.
5. Apply all the migration scripts between 3.0.0 and 3.2.0 (3.0.0 ≤ version \< 3.2.0).
6. Live-upgrade the Procrastinate version used in your services, from 3.0.0 and 3.2.0.

Following this process you can go from 1.6.0 to 3.2.0 with no service discontinuity.
