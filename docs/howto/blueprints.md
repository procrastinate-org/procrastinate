# Create modular collections of tasks by using Blueprints

Procrastinate provides Blueprints as a way to factor a large number of tasks
into smaller self contained collections.

You may want to create a collection for simple organsational reasons within the
same project. Or you may want to maintain a collection of tasks in a seperate
package which is maintained independently of your Procrastinate codebase:

```
...

from my_external_package import tasks_blueprint
...

app.add_tasks_from(tasks_blueprint, namespace="my_external_package")
```

Blueprints are easy to use, and task creation follows the pattern and API as
{py:meth}`App.task`.

Firstly, create a Blueprint instance and then create some tasks:

```
from procrastinate import Blueprint

my_blueprint = Blueprint()

@my_blueprint.task()
def mytask(argument, other_argument):
    ...
```

In your project register the blueprint with the {py:class}`App` after you have created it:

```
from procrastinate import AiopgConnector, App

app = App(connector=AiopgConnector())

app.add_tasks_from(my_blueprint, namespace="unique_name")
```
