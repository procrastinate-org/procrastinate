Procrastinate is an open-source Python 3.6+ distributed task processing
library, leveraging PostgreSQL to store task definitions, manage locks and
dispatch tasks. The project is still quite early-stage and will probably evolve.

Here's an example

.. code-block:: python

    # Make a app in your code
    app = procrastinate.App(job_store=procrastinate.PostgresJobStore())

    # Then define tasks
    @app.task(queue="sums")
    def sum(a, b):
        with open("myfile", "w") as f:
            f.write(str(a + b))

    # Launch tasks
    sum.defer(a=3, b=5)

    # Somewhere in your program, launch a worker
    worker = procrastinate.Worker(
        app=app,
        queues=["sums"]
    )
    worker.run()

There are quite a few interesting features that Procrastinate adds to the mix.
You can head to the Quickstart section for a general tour or
to the How-To sections for specific features. The Discussion
section should hopefully answer your questions. Otherwise,
feel free to open an `issue <https://github.com/peopledoc/procrastinate/issues>`_.

*Note to my future self: add a quick note here on why this project is named*
"Procrastinate_".
