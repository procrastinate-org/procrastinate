    The RetryStrategy class should handle classic retry strategies.

    You can mix and match several waiting strategies. The formula is::

        total_wait = wait + lineal_wait * attempts + exponential_wait ** (attempts + 1)

    Parameters
    ----------
    max_attempts:
        The maximum number of attempts the job should be retried
    wait:
        Use this if you want to use a constant backoff.
        Give a number of seconds as argument, it will be used to compute the backoff.
        (e.g. if 3, then successive runs will wait 3, 3, 3, 3, 3 seconds)
    linear_wait:
        Use this if you want to use a linear backoff.
        Give a number of seconds as argument, it will be used to compute the backoff.
        (e.g. if 3, then successive runs will wait 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 seconds)
    exponential_wait:
        Use this if you want to use an exponential backoff.
        Give a number of seconds as argument, it will be used to compute the backoff.
        (e.g. if 3, then successive runs will wait 3, 9, 27, 81, 243 seconds)
    retry_exceptions:
        Define the exception types you want to retry on.
        If you don't, jobs will be retried on any type of exceptions
